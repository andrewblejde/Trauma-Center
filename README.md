# Trauma-Center
This code was used for a project to map trauma centers verified by the American College of Surgeons over demographic data from the 2010 US Census. The code includes reading a cleaned file, fetching associated latitude-longitude co-ordinates for the given addresses, and producing a JSON array of trauma centers. This was built on top of a [map](http://demographics.coopercenter.org/DotMap/) of demographic data produced by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia.

The finished product can be found [here.](http://blejde.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/chicago/)
